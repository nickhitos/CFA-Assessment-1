1. What is the URL to your GitHub-Pages site?

    https://nickhitos.github.io/cfa-assessment-1/

2. What API did you use and why?

    I used the FishWatch API because I saw an opportunity to give users
    the ability to sort the various species of fish by their nutritional
    value, which is a feature not currently available on the FishWatch
    website.

3. What are some other applications for your API other than searching?
Name a few and describe how an app using it for that purpose might work.

    The information provided by FishWatch can aid a user in making smart
    seafood choices or to get up-to-date information on fish harvested in
    the U.S. As an example, a nutrition app to log meals can utilize the
    nutrition facts provided by the FishWatch API to give the user a
    breakdown of the nutrients and vitamins they are consuming. Likewise,
    an app that provides recipes may use the API to inform the user when
    a particular fish is in season or to provide information on the taste
    and texture of a particular fish.

4. Explain the considerations you needed to make for the website to be
responsive & mobile-friendly.

    One of the considerations made was how the search bar and filter field would
    dynamically shift as the window reduced in size. This was necessary to provide
    users on a smaller screen an easy to use and aesthetic experience similar to
    that on a normally sized window.

5. How can you make your app accessible to people with disabilities such
as blindness or colorblindness?

    For people with blindness, making the application compatible with screen readers
    would be the method of choice. For people that are color blind, having an option
    to change the colors on the page in accordance with the type of colorblindness
    would be a solution.

6. If you could make further changes to your project to improve/expand the
experience, what would they be and how would you go about implementing them?

    Given more time, I would have liked to implement the ability to pull up
    more information about a specific fish. While most of the information provided 
    by the FishWatch API is valuable and relevant, displaying all the information
    on one page may overwhelm the user and force the user to parse through
    irrelevant information.
